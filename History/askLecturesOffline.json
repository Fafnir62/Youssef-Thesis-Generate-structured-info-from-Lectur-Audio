    "question": "What is Cloud Computing",
    "answer": "Cloud computing is dealing with technology that we've had around for a long time. Storage compute, AI systems, applications, you know, all these things that we're able to run on premise or on our desktops, but we're just doing it as a service and consuming it over the open internet. And that provides us with the capability of having more convenient access to these resources than if we have to buy and set up and maintain our own physical hardware within our particular data center."
